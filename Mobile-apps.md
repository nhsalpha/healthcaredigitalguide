#### When you should build an app

[Cabinet Office policy on mobile apps](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/03/12/were-not-appy-not-appy-at-all/)

* Provided by: GDS
* Applies to: all new or existing mobile apps created by central government and ALBs

#### Getting permission to build or develop an app

The use of mobile apps is not a replacement for building a mobile responsive website. Stand-alone apps will only be considered for approval once a core web service works well on all mobile devices. If you think there is a good case for the inclusion of a mobile app as part of your digital project, you should speak with the DH Digital Team and provide clear evidence of the user need that can only be fulfilled with this solution. 

Approval is also required for any spending on existing mobile apps, including upgrades or redesign, including apps developed by partner organisations. Your spend request should be accompanied by convincing evidence to support the continuation of the existing mobile app.

There are some instances when a native mobile app would be of value to the user. These include, but are not limited to:

* Where digital information is essential without an internet connection.  A good example of this is the NICE Guidance app. 
* Where there is a need or a user demand for continued engagement with the mobile app - regularly using it or updating data. A good example of this is Public Health Englandâ€™s Couch to 5k mobile app.
