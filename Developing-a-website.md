# Developing a new website

## Build digital services, not websites

A service is something that helps people to do something. Our job is to uncover user needs, and build the service that meets those needs. Of course much of that will be pages on the web, but we’re not here to build websites. 

The digital world has to connect to the real world, so we have to think about all aspects of a service, and make sure they add up to something that meets user needs.

## Getting approval for websites

All spending proposals for a new website or the redevelopment of an existing website are subject to digital controls. Government policy is that government must not create competing sources of information outside GOV.UK on partner sites or microsites. 

Before proposing a new website **for professional audiences**, the use of [GOV.UK](www.gov.uk) or an existing organisation’s website should be considered first.

Before proposing a new website **for citizens**, the use of NHS Choices should be considered first.

The re-development of an existing website would include: 
* changes to underlying technology (such as a replacement new CMS sub-sites or microsites) 
* changes to existing functionality
* the addition of new functions
* 'business as usual' improvements (e.g. changes to the site's design, contract renewals, licenses)

Improvement or maintenance of an existing website that is specifically included within existing approvals does not need to be re-approved. Nor does content creation and development.
