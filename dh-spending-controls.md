# Department of Health spending controls

This page sets out the spend controls processes that apply to digital services and websites. It has been written for all DH and ALB teams working on digital projects. 

DH follows the controls and standards set down by the Cabinet Office. The controls exist to make sure all digital products meet citizens’ needs and are cost-effective. Approval is required for: 

* all spending on websites or digital services.
* setting up new website domains not on [GOV.UK](www.gov.uk) or NHS.UK.
* any digital elements of a wider communications campaign.

All new digital services must meet the [Digital by Default Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default) found in the [Government Service Design Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). All new web domains must clearly be exempt from [GOV.UK](www.gov.uk) and NHS.UK. 

Questions or suggestions should be sent to DigitalProjects@dh.gsi.gov.uk.

## Digital assurance process

1. Pre-engagement: share quarterly strategic pipeline with DH Digital
2. Discovery: 
3. Submit control form to DH Digital Team 
4. Assessment against standards
5. Approval
6. Continuous improvement

## Am I subject to controls? 

Since 2010, all new ICT projects over £1m, all paid for communications, advertising and marketing activity, and all digital projects over £100,000 are subject to controls.

The controls **apply** to all central government bodies and ALBs. This includes organisations that are funded by DH or an ALB such as Genomics England or Skills for Care.

The controls **do not apply** to Clinical Commissioning Groups, Commissioning Support Units or the local NHS. However, if these organisations are commissioned to run a project and given additional funds by DH and or any other controlled body, then the controls will apply to that funding and activity. 

Spend controls apply regardless of the funding source. DH and ALB teams must also follow their delegated financial approval limits, and submit to the Investment Approvals section of DH Group Finance if the lifetime investment cost is more than £5m.  

### What do I need to do?

Early engagement with the DH Digital Team is strongly encouraged, as it helps speed up the approvals process. We can support you with developing your proposals and projects, as well as sharing best practice from others. For teams to get the best out of us, there are a few simple things they should focus on. 

### Starting out

As well as discussing individual projects as they arise, ALB Digital Leaders should share a **forward plan of digital activity** with the team on a quarterly basis. This should set out what is happening when, and how it fits with the strategic plans of the organisation. 

We also expect project teams to **read existing guidance** set out in the [Government Service Design Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), and elsewhere on this wiki. 

Early engagement allows the DH team to target support and plan **engagement with GDS**, which makes the whole approvals process more straightforward later on. 

### Running a successful discovery

Before coming to the DH team with a digital service proposition, teams should be able to provide evidence that answers 10 key questions. These provide a focus for the [discovery phase of a project](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases/discovery.html). 

Failing to answer these questions with clear evidence is the most common reason for delayed approvals. 

**1. Who are your users?**

What are the defining characteristics (demographics, motivations, attitudes, behaviours) of the people using this service or website? How many are there? How many will need assisted digital support? 

[User personas and stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) are a great way of capturing this information. 

**2. What are their needs?**

What requirements will each user group have of your service? How will these differ for those using assisted digital channels?

A prioritised list of [user stories](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html) is the best way to summarise your findings. 
 
**3. How are these needs being fulfilled now?**

How are users currently doing what they need to do? How successfully are they doing it?

[User journeys](http://theuxreview.co.uk/user-journeys-beginners-guide/) document the paths users currently take in order to do what they want. 

**4. How does your idea fit with wider strategic objectives?**

What are your organisation’s high level objectives? How does your project align with these? Who are the key stakeholders and what are their expectations? How does it align with cross-government or health and social case objectives?

Your Digital Roadmap (that should be shared with the DH Digital team quarterly) should explain how your project fits in the context of your organisation’s strategic aims.

**5. What does your organisation currently do?**

What does [analytics](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/analytics-tools.html) tell you about the current website or service? What technology contracts do you have in place? What length and cost are they? How many people work on the current website or service, and what do they do?

Facts and figures on current services, including performance data, the number of users and costs, are invaluable for building a strong investment case. 

**6. Is anyone else doing / done anything similar?** 

Have other departments, sectors or countries learned lessons from doing something similar? Have they created anything you can re-use? 

Sharing your plans with us means we can identify any complimentary or contradictory projects elsewhere in government. You should also share plans with the ALB digital leaders group.

**7. What different options have you explored for delivering this?**

Do you have a clear understanding of the different approaches or technology solutions that could meet the user needs identified? On what basis have you selected your preferred option?

We will look for teams to show evidence that they have considered how your internal team will work with the team building the digital project, that there is sufficient capability to build and run the finished product, how much it will cost and how you plan to procure external services.

**8. What is your overall plan for the project?**

How will your idea be delivered in reality? How many sprints and periods of user testing do you expect? How long do you expect the discovery, alpha and beta phases to last?

This doesn't mean a precisely detailed Gantt chart. We are looking for high-level milestones, dependencies and any hard-stops such as contract renewals, as well as a clear sense of what we be achieved by when.

**9. What is the detailed plan for the next phase?**

What ideas do you plan to test in this phase? What are your expected outcomes? How long will this phase last? How big is the team, what skills are in it, and how much will it cost?

Bilding digital services is an iterative process of experimentation and testing hypotheses. We are looking for teams to show they have a clear idea of what they're looking for, why, and how they plan to use a multidisciplinary team to test their theories.

**10. How are you ensuring this product can be iteratively developed after launch?**

How will you measure success? What provision have you made to acquire and fund digital capability responsible for maintaining and improving this product?

Too often, digital services get launched and then forgotten. We are looking for a clear plan that shows how the service will be operated and improved using feedback, and if there is a transition that involves replacing old services with the new proposition. 

### Completing a spend control form 

Once you have completed a discovery phase, you should have much of the evidence needed to fill out a spending control form. All requests for digital spend approval will need to be accompanied one of these, to be assessed by the DH Digital Team in the first instance. GDS will not consider spend control forms that have not already been approved by the DH Digital Approvals Panel. 

Applicants submitting a spend control form to DH Digital will receive email confirmation of receipt within 5 days, followed by approval, rejection or a request for more information.

Approvals may include conditions, which will need to be included within the project development. If a project is rejected, the notice will be accompanied with the reasons why and, if possible, a suggested way forward or alternative solutions. 

##Service Assessments

Service assessments are carried out on all transactional services; those that involve an exchange of information, money, rights, goods or some combination of these.

GDS leads on the assessment of new or re-designed services that process, or are likely to process, transactional services that have a throughput of over 100,000 transactions. DH will assess services that do not meet this threshold. Service assessments take place at the end of alpha development, the end of beta development, and immediately before a live release.

During assessment, a panel of expert assessors meets with representatives of the project. The panel is likely to include a technical architect, a user researcher and either a digital designer, delivery manager or product manager. A security specialist may also take part. The Service Manager and project team will be asked to explain a course of actions or decisions, and provide evidence to support their answers.  

The panel will test a project against each of the 18 points of the standard. A copy of the prompts and evidence used by the assessors during an assessment can be found on the Government Service Design Manual. 

In advance of the assessment, the service team will be asked to provide:

* a brief description of the service and its intended users
* details of the service(s) the new one will replace or complement
* where appropriate, an up-to-date link to the most recent version of the service 
* a high level technical architecture diagram 
* where appropriate, details of any outstanding security or privacy accreditation
* a demonstration of the digital service

Following an assessment, the lead assessor will produce a report to the DH Digital Leader on the panel’s findings. This report is based on each of the service standards and will include observations that would be of help to the project.  The report will content a conclusion stating that the project has passed or failed the assessment.  If a project does not pass, the project will be asked to make corrections and resubmit.  Further spending on the project will not be approved without a remediation plan.

## Other considerations

### Who approves spending?

All spending in the following categories requires approval from the **DH Digital Leader and GDS**:

* New websites
* Domain registration (new domains)
* Mobile apps
* Digital transactions (new or redeveloped)
* Identity assurance for the general public

Spending on the following items requires approval from the **DH Digital Leader**. If the total amount is more than £100,000 is requested, **GDS** must also approve:

* Any ‘business as usual’ changes, maintenance or refreshes 
* Contracts (including amendments, extensions or renewals)
* Licences
* Expenditure through existing frameworks 
* Digital services
* User needs research
* Feasibility, discovery, pilot and/or proof of concept studies
* E-learning systems (if there is a citizen-facing element)

### What if changes have to be made after approval is given?

As a proposal moves through the alpha, beta, etc stages of approval, it is expected that some aspects may change. This could include cost. These changes should always be refinements of accuracy, rather than unplanned developments or increases in costs. 

When approval is given, this is the maximum spend available to the project and must not be exceeded without a further submission. Any project that is likely to exceed the approved cost must be resubmitted for approval before any further funds can be used.  Approval of additional funds is not automatic and may be rejected.

### What if a project has been started without approval?

In extreme circumstances it may be necessary to apply for retrospective approval.  In this case the same set of information needs to be provided at the same level of detail as would be provided for a non-retrospective application.  This will need to be accompanied by an explanation as to why the submission is retrospective and what steps are being taken to avoid any repeat of this situation.  

It should be noted that there is no guarantee that approval will be granted, which may result in services being withdrawn.  
  
### How do I calculate the amount I want approval to spend?

Approval should be sought for the full lifetime cost of the service. In this context, a lifetime cost means the total cost of ownership, not just the costs relating to development, initial purchases or site build. 

All applications, including concept and discovery, need to provide the likely budget requirement.  At a high level, this budget should indicate the split between admin, programme and/or capital, and confirmation that the costs can be met from within your existing allocation, or if funding is to be transferred in from elsewhere. Cost can be estimated, but should be broken down by activities such as research, development, project management and technology.  It is important to include the cost of any irrecoverable VAT.

For in-house managed digital activity, you might not have as detailed costs as you would have from a commercial proposal. However, it is expected that your submission for spend approval will include an estimated internal cost for the entire project. The cost should take account of any opportunity costs; cost that would occur from resources and people involved in a digital project that may have been deployed elsewhere.

Digital controls apply where the development is done by contractors or contingent labour, and these costs must be reflected in the approvals submission. Intentionally dividing a programme into smaller elements to avoid the controls process is itself a serious breach of the controls.
